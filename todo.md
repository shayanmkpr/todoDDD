## To Do(lol):

### Where we are:
    - users can login, they get refresh tokens and access tokens. Should review it again might have some janky logic for access and refresh token.

### What should be done:
    - refresh tokens should be correctly stored in redis. They are not now.
    - write unit tests and db tests for the ath logic.
    - **Big Deal:** Add the whole todo logic.
